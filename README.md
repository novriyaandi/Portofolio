# Novriandi - Portofolio

## About Me
Hi, I'm Novri! I’am  a fresh graduate bachelors of Math from Diponegoro University. I have the desire to develop my career in various tech fields such as Business Development, Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Data Engineer and Product Owner. I had a curious about the world  and also want to learn new things and enjoy new experiences. Individuals who are hardworking, organized, have goals and future plans that strive to be carried out in a disciplined manner.

## Introduction
Picture me as a data alchemist, transmuting raw information into gold through the intricate arts of analytics, science, engineering, and the nuanced choreography of machine learning. It's not just about numbers; it's a symphony of patterns, a dance of correlations, and an exploration of the uncharted territories of knowledge.

In the quietude of my free moments, I embark on an intellectual quest, deciphering the cryptic language of data. It's a perpetual learning curve, a journey where curiosity is the compass, and each algorithm is a stepping stone towards a deeper understanding.

Eager to engage with fellow minds who share this fervor for unraveling the enigma of data. Let's not just crunch numbers but compose stories and unravel the secrets hidden within the labyrinth of information.

## Capstone Project Dicoding Indonesia


**Description** : The final project for 5 month Machine Learning & Front-End Developer, held by Dicoding Indonesia.Indonesia is a country with an extraordinary wealth of plant diversity. Many Indonesian people utilize this plant diversity as their main livelihood, such as agriculture and plantations. Therefore, plants are one of the living things that are quite important for Indonesia, which is an agricultural country. However, just like other living things, plants can also have dangerous and deadly diseases. This is a major concern for plant lovers in general. If people can find out the disease in their plants before things get worse, of course, prevention of plant death can be done as early as possible. 

However, how can people know the disease of their plants and whether looking at the physical symptoms is enough to detect the disease, is still a question that must be resolved. This prompted us to create a plant disease detection system. Just like diseases in other living things, of course, diseases in plants also have characteristics and symptoms. With the existence of a machine learning-based website that can detect plant diseases based on the characteristics and symptoms of the disease, people can easily find out and overcome diseases in their plants.

Heal Plant is a machine learning-based website, in order to help the general public to identify diseases affecting their plants and recommend suitable medicine for them.

## Final Project 1 Dicoding Indonesia


**Description** : Nowadays, movies have become one of the main favorite entertainments of the people. The number of movies per year is calculated to reach thousands. This creates a situation where we have difficulty in finding information that suits the criteria of movie fans. The possibility of a movie that he had not thought of at all but turned out to be interesting to see and according to one's taste. One solution to this problem is a recommendation system that utilizes other people's opinions or ratings of a movie. 

A recommendation system is a system that assists users in overcoming information overload by providing specific recommendations for users and it is hoped that these recommendations can fulfill the wants and needs of users. But in its development, a model is needed that can provide more value to customers in the form of recommendations that can provide information about products that are considered in accordance with customer desires.

Based on the previously described conditions, I developed model for a movie recommendation system to answer the following problems:

How to create a collaborative filtering model for movie recommendation system?

## Final Project 2 Dicoding Indonesia


**Description** : Global warming is the observed increase in the earth's average temperature. The main cause of this phenomenon is the release of greenhouse gases with the burning of fossil fuels, land clearing, agriculture, among others, leading to an increase in the so-called greenhouse effect. 

An approach to deal with this important issue is time series analysis. In this case, different techniques can be applied to evaluate the dynamics of global warming. This kind of analysis allows one to make better predictions improving our understanding of the phenomenon.

Based on the previously described conditions, i developed model for temperature prediction system to answer the following problems:

Has the average temperature of the earth's surface changed since 1750?

How to determine the forecasting model for the change of average earth surface temperature?
