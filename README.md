# Novriandi - Portofolio

## About Me
Hi, I'm Novri! I’am  a fresh graduate bachelors of Math from Diponegoro University. I have the desire to develop my career in various tech fields such as Business Development, Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Data Engineer and Product Owner. I had a curious about the world  and also want to learn new things and enjoy new experiences. Individuals who are hardworking, organized, have goals and future plans that strive to be carried out in a disciplined manner.

## Introduction
Picture me as a data alchemist, transmuting raw information into gold through the intricate arts of analytics, science, engineering, and the nuanced choreography of machine learning. It's not just about numbers; it's a symphony of patterns, a dance of correlations, and an exploration of the uncharted territories of knowledge.

In the quietude of my free moments, I embark on an intellectual quest, deciphering the cryptic language of data. It's a perpetual learning curve, a journey where curiosity is the compass, and each algorithm is a stepping stone towards a deeper understanding.

Eager to engage with fellow minds who share this fervor for unraveling the enigma of data. Let's not just crunch numbers but compose stories and unravel the secrets hidden within the labyrinth of information.

## Capstone Project Kitong Indonesia


**Description** : The final project for 5 month Data Analysis Course, held by MyEduSolve. In order to realize the entrepreneurial ecosystem in Eastern Indonesia, the management of the beneficiaries database is crucial to be the basis for measuring the impact of Kitong Indonesia's social efforts.
The objectives of this project are:

● Knowing the reach of the target beneficiaries that have been achieved.

● Analyze the sustainable impact based on the beneficiaries data owned

● Create a better beneficiaries database management system

**Role** : Project Manager

**Skills** : Microsoft Excel, Pivot Table, Data Analytics, Canva

## Capstone Project Dicoding Indonesia


**Description** : The final project for 5 month Machine Learning & Front-End Developer, held by Dicoding Indonesia.Indonesia is a country with an extraordinary wealth of plant diversity. Many Indonesian people utilize this plant diversity as their main livelihood, such as agriculture and plantations. Therefore, plants are one of the living things that are quite important for Indonesia, which is an agricultural country. However, just like other living things, plants can also have dangerous and deadly diseases. This is a major concern for plant lovers in general. If people can find out the disease in their plants before things get worse, of course, prevention of plant death can be done as early as possible. 

However, how can people know the disease of their plants and whether looking at the physical symptoms is enough to detect the disease, is still a question that must be resolved. This prompted us to create a plant disease detection system. Just like diseases in other living things, of course, diseases in plants also have characteristics and symptoms. With the existence of a machine learning-based website that can detect plant diseases based on the characteristics and symptoms of the disease, people can easily find out and overcome diseases in their plants.

Heal Plant is a machine learning-based website, in order to help the general public to identify diseases affecting their plants and recommend suitable medicine for them.

## Machine Learning Project

### IndoNLU

**Description** : IndoNLU Datasets Machine Learning Projects. IndoNLU is a collection of Natural Language Understanding (NLU) resources for Bahasa Indonesia with 12 downstream tasks. They provide the code to reproduce the results and large pre-trained models (IndoBERT and IndoBERT-lite) trained with around 4 billion word corpus (Indo4B), more than 20 GB of text data. The goal is here to build ML model that can recognize words and phrase as they positive, negative or neutral.


**Library** : Numpy, Pandas, Torch, Matplotlib, Tensorflow, SKLearn.
